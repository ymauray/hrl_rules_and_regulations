# Proposal for a change in how points are awarded for season 3

Between season 2 and 3, I propose we test a new way to score the races, and see if we want to implement that for season 3.

We could have a stage racing format, in which we would race the same track 3 times :

* Stage 1 : a 3 laps race, 1st place gets 3 points, 2nd place gets 2 points, 3rd place gets 1 point. The rest of the field doesn't get anything
* Stage 2 : same thing
* Stage 3 : a 5 laps race, points are attributed the usual way (12 to 5), DNFs do get points according to their finishing position.

Because of the increased number of laps per "race" (11 laps total), the mirrored tracks would be dropped.

I also suggest we drop the "end of event" standings, and just go with the "race" standings, as it is done in "real life", i.e. we would take all 20 tracks into account to compute the final standings. 

I propose we test this format between seasons 2 and 3, maybe during an extended session in which we would run a significant number of tracks to see the system in action.
